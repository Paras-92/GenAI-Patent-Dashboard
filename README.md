# **Generative AI Patent Analysis - Power BI Project**

## **Overview**
This repository contains a **Power BI project** that analyzes trends in **Generative AI patents** using a **synthetic dataset**. The dataset was designed to reflect real-world AI patent filing trends, technological advancements, and industry adoption.

## **Project Components**
- **Dataset:** `Gen_AI_Patent_Data.csv` (compressed version also available)
- **Power BI Report:** `Project_Gen_AI.pbix`
- **Insights Report:** `PowerBI_Insights_Report.pdf`
- **Screenshots of Dashboards:** `Project_Gen_AI.pdf`
- **README File:** (this document)

## **Dataset Details**
The dataset is synthetic and includes the following columns:
- **Patent Number**
- **Title**
- **Filing Year, Publication Year, Grant Year, Expiration Year**
- **Assignee Name & Country, Inventor Name & Country**
- **IPC Code, CPC Code, USPC Code**
- **Technology Sector, Legal Status**
- **Cited and Citing Patents Count**
- **Filing, Publication, and Granting Country**
- **Patent Valuation, Litigation Data, Licensing Status**
- **AI Model Type, Neural Network Architecture, Training Method, Programming Frameworks**
- **Industry Use Case**
- **Filing Date, Grant Date, Assignee, Country**

## **Generating Synthetic Data**
The dataset was generated using:
1. **Defined Data Structure** based on real-world AI patent attributes.
2. **Randomized & Skewed Distributions** to simulate realistic trends.
3. **Validation & Cleaning** to ensure no missing values or inconsistencies.

## **Key Insights from the Power BI Report**
